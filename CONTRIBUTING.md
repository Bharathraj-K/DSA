## Code of Conduct

Please review and follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/abhishektripathi66/DSA/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). We are committed to maintaining a welcoming environment for all contributors.

## How to Contribute

There are several ways to contribute to this project:

- **Fix bugs** or improve the existing codebase.
- **Add new data structures** or algorithm implementations, including Leetcode solutions or interview questions.
- **Enhance documentation** and improve code readability.
- **Suggest new features** or improvements related to DSA topics.

Please ensure that any code contributions align with the **DSA and Problem-Solving** theme of the project.

## Reporting Bugs

If you encounter a bug:

1. Search for existing issues to check if itâ€™s already been reported.
2. If not, [create a new issue](https://github.com/abhishektripathi66/DSA/issues).
3. Provide a detailed description of the issue.
4. Include steps to reproduce the problem, if applicable.
5. Attach any relevant logs or context that can help us understand the issue.

## Feature Requests

For suggesting new features or improvements:

1. Open a [new issue](https://github.com/abhishektripathi66/DSA/issues).
2. Provide a detailed explanation of the problem you're addressing.
3. Describe how your proposed feature fits into the project.

## Code Contribution Guidelines

We welcome code contributions! Please follow these guidelines to ensure consistency and maintainability:

### File Naming

- Use descriptive and meaningful names for files that represent the data structure or algorithm implemented.
  - Example: `BinarySearchTree.java`, `QuickSort.java`

### Coding Style

- Follow standard Java conventions:
  - **Variables and methods:** Use camelCase.
  - **Classes:** Use PascalCase.
- Avoid redundant comments but document complex or non-obvious logic.
- **Indentation:** Use 4 spaces, no tabs.
- Limit each line to 100 characters.
- Include **JavaDocs** for all methods and classes.

### Testing

- Every new data structure or algorithm must have corresponding unit tests.
- Use JUnit 5 (or specify another framework, if preferred).
- Tests should cover both edge cases and expected behavior.

### Commit Messages

- Write clear and concise commit messages that explain the changes.
  - Example: `Added QuickSort algorithm with tests` or `Fixed issue in LinkedList implementation`.
- If your commit addresses an open issue, reference the issue number.

## Pull Request Process

To submit your contributions, follow these steps:

1. **Fork the repository** and create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
  - Naming convention for branches: `feature/algorithm-name` or `fix/issue-description`.
2. **Ensure no existing functionality is broken** by running tests before submitting your PR.
3. **Submit a pull request (PR)** with:
  - A clear description of the changes.
  - References to relevant issues, if applicable.
4. Your PR will be reviewed, and feedback may be provided. Please be responsive to review comments and adjust your PR accordingly.
