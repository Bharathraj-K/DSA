Hint
Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

 **/
/**
we use remainder.

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 9
To explain the algorithm first, it performs three reverse operations.

First of all, we reverse all numbers.

[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
↓
[7,6,5,4,3,2,1]
Then, we create two groups like solution 2. Before k and After k.

     k
[7,6,5,4,3,2,1]
 # # * * * * *

k is remainder
Then, reverse all numbers in each group.

     k
[7,6,5,4,3,2,1]
 # # * * * * *
↓
     k
[6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
 # # * * * * *
[6,7,1,2,3,4,5] is actually answer.

To summarize the algorithm, we use 3 reverse operation.

reverse(0, last index) → whole array
reverse(0, k - 1) → before k
reverse(k, last index) → after k
Let's see solution codes!

Complexity
Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)

        while (left < right) {
            int temp = nums[left];
            nums[left] = nums[right];
            nums[right] = temp;
