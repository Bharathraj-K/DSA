SQL Coding Challenge
Problem Description
You are managing a database for a local library. Your task is to analyze the current borrowing activity to understand which books are currently on loan and by whom.

You need to retrieve a list that includes:

The first_name, last_name, and email of all members.
For each member, the title of any book they currently have on loan (meaning the return_date in the Loans table is NULL).
If a member has no current loans, they should still be included in the list, with NULL for the book title.
Additionally, for each book that is currently on loan, include its genre.

Table Structure
1. Members Table

member_id (INT, PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT)
first_name (VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL)
last_name (VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL)
email (VARCHAR(80) NOT NULL)
membership_date (DATE NOT NULL)

2. Books Table
book_id (INT, PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT)
title (VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL)
author (VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL)
genre (VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL)
publication_year (INT)
existing_copies (INT NOT NULL)

3. Loans Table
loan_id (INT, PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT)
member_id (INT, FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Members(member_id) NOT NULL)
book_id (INT, FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Books(book_id) NOT NULL)
loan_date (DATE NOT NULL)
return_date (DATE NULLABLE)

Write a single SQL query to achieve the requirements described above.

Solution :

SELECT
    M.first_name,
    M.last_name,
    M.email,
    B.title AS current_loan_book_title,
    B.genre AS current_loan_book_genre
FROM
    Members M
LEFT JOIN
    Loans L ON M.member_id = L.member_id AND L.return_date IS NULL
INNER JOIN
    Books B ON L.book_id = B.book_id;
