 * 3314. Construct the Minimum Bitwise Array I

Hint
You are given an array nums consisting of n 
prime
 integers.

You need to construct an array ans of length n, such that, for each index i, the bitwise OR of ans[i] and ans[i] + 1 is equal to nums[i], i.e. ans[i] OR (ans[i] + 1) == nums[i].

Additionally, you must minimize each value of ans[i] in the resulting array.

If it is not possible to find such a value for ans[i] that satisfies the condition, then set ans[i] = -1.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,3,5,7]

Output: [-1,1,4,3]

Explanation:

For i = 0, as there is no value for ans[0] that satisfies ans[0] OR (ans[0] + 1) = 2, so ans[0] = -1.
For i = 1, the smallest ans[1] that satisfies ans[1] OR (ans[1] + 1) = 3 is 1, because 1 OR (1 + 1) = 3.
For i = 2, the smallest ans[2] that satisfies ans[2] OR (ans[2] + 1) = 5 is 4, because 4 OR (4 + 1) = 5.
For i = 3, the smallest ans[3] that satisfies ans[3] OR (ans[3] + 1) = 7 is 3, because 3 OR (3 + 1) = 7.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [11,13,31]

Output: [9,12,15]

Explanation:

For i = 0, the smallest ans[0] that satisfies ans[0] OR (ans[0] + 1) = 11 is 9, because 9 OR (9 + 1) = 11.
For i = 1, the smallest ans[1] that satisfies ans[1] OR (ans[1] + 1) = 13 is 12, because 12 OR (12 + 1) = 13.
For i = 2, the smallest ans[2] that satisfies ans[2] OR (ans[2] + 1) = 31 is 15, because 15 OR (15 + 1) = 31.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 100
2 <= nums[i] <= 1000
nums[i] is a prime number.

ans[i] OR (ans[i] + 1) == nums[i]
ans[i] and ans[i] + 1 are one odd and one even.
nums[i] is an odd.


Explanation
..0111 || (..0111 + 1) = ..1111
The effect is that change the rightmost 0 to 1.

For each a in array A,
find the rightmost 0,
and set the next bit from 1 to 0.

a + 1 will filp the 1-suffix to 0-suffix,
and flip the rightmost 0 to 1.
a & -a is a trick to get the rightmost 1.
