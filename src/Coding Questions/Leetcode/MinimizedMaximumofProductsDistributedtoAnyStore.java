Hint
You are given an integer n indicating there are n specialty retail stores. There are m product types of varying amounts, which are given as a 0-indexed integer array quantities, where quantities[i] represents the number of products of the ith product type.

You need to distribute all products to the retail stores following these rules:

A store can only be given at most one product type but can be given any amount of it.
After distribution, each store will have been given some number of products (possibly 0). Let x represent the maximum number of products given to any store. You want x to be as small as possible, i.e., you want to minimize the maximum number of products that are given to any store.
Return the minimum possible x.


Solution
Intuition
The problem aims to find the smallest maximum number of products that can be allocated to a store while distributing the quantities among n stores. To achieve this, we can use a binary search approach to minimize the maximum number of products (item) allocated per store.

The function solve checks whether it’s possible to allocate quantities such that each store gets no more than item products, and no more than n stores are used.

Approach
Binary Search:
• We define low as 1 and high as the maximum number of products in quantities. This represents the possible range of values for item.
• We use binary search to find the smallest value of item that allows distributing all products among n stores.
Feasibility Check (solve function):
• For each value of item, we determine if it's feasible to allocate the products such that no store receives more than item products.
• For each quantity, calculate how many stores are needed if each store receives a maximum of item products using (product - 1) / item + 1 (equivalent to ceil(product / item)).
• If the total number of stores required exceeds n, this value of item is too small, so we need to increase item.
• If the number of stores required is within n, then this value of item is feasible, so we attempt to find a smaller maximum by setting high = mid - 1.
Updating Answer:
• If solve returns true, we store mid as a potential answer and continue to search for a smaller feasible maximum by updating high.
• Otherwise, we update low to search in the higher range of values.
Result:
• When the binary search completes, ans contains the smallest feasible maximum number of products per store.
Complexity
Time complexity:
    O(m * log(max(quantities))).
Space complexity:
    O(1)
