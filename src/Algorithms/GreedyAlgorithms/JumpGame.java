/*
 * Jump Game to find minimum jumps to reach end
 * 
 * Given an array of positive integer where each index represents maximum jump can be made from that index.
 * Find minimum jumps to reach at the end of array or beyond that.
 * 
 * In this solution greedy approach is used. It can solved using dp as well, but in that time complextiy will be O(n^2).
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n)
 * Auxilliary Space Complexity: O(1)
 *
 * Example:
 *   nums = [2,3,1,1,4] â†’ Max value = 240.0
