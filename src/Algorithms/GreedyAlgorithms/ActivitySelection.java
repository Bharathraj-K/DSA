/*
 * Activity Selection Problem 
 * 
 * Given n activities with start and end time and we have to find out maximum number of activities completed
 * without overlapping with each other.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n log n) for sorting
 * Auxilliary Space Complexity: O(1) (ignoring input)
 *
 * Example:
 *    Activities = [(1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5), (0, 6), (5, 7), (8, 9), (5, 9)]
 *    â†’ Max non-overlapping = 4 (which are (1,3), (3,5), (5,7), (8,9))
