Bubble Sort

Description

Bubble Sort repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order, effectively "bubbling"
the largest elements to the end in each pass.

Steps:

Traverse the array.

Compare adjacent elements.

Swap if out of order.

Repeat until the array is sorted.

Time Complexity:

Best Case: O(n) (when already sorted)

Average Case: O(n^2)

Worst Case: O(n^2)

Space Complexity:

O(1)

Advantages:

✅ Simple to implement.✅ Easy to understand.

Limitations:

❌ Inefficient on large datasets.

Use Cases:

Educational purposes.

Small datasets where simplicity is preferred.
